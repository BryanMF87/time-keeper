## Project details
I've become comfortable as a Javascript developer however I needed a way to track how long I work on projects. While I could track my time on paper or download a 3rd party app, I thought creating one myself would be great practice. This project features individual action-item time tracking, mobile-first responsive design, local storage information saving, and a night-mode for after hour coding use.

## Project challenges
My major roadblock were trying to add event listeners onto dynamically created dom elements as they were created, and learning to switch content out of local storage. It took time to understand the real problem I was facing in these instances, but once I understood why my code wasn't working, I found the answers pretty quickly from online forums.

## Project lessons
The biggest lesson I took away from this project was "event delagation", the use of attaching an event listener to a parent element to use on its dynamic child elements. This was also the first time I used multiple css design themes for a project, and I learned the basics of regular expression (regex) to format time.
